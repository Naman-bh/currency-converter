🧠 How it Works

    The user selects a "From" currency and a "To" currency.
    The JavaScript app sends a request to the Frankfurter API to get the current exchange rate for 1 unit.
    The app then multiplies this rate by the user's input amount.
    The result is displayed instantly on the screen.
